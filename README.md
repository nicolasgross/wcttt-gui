# WCT続-GUI

WCT続 (WIAI Course Timetabling Tool) is a software that strives to automate the
timetabling process at the WIAI faculty of the University of Bamberg. It was
developed by [Nicolas Gross](https://github.com/nicolasgross) as part of his
bachelor thesis at the Software Technologies Research Group (SWT).

This is the GUI module of WCT続. Its interface comprises functionality to view 
generated timetables, edit semester data and to generate new timetables.


## Notice

Sometimes the 'Rename' menu item in the context menu of the timetable list stays
visually disabled despite only one timetable is selected. The same behaviour can
be observed with the 'Save' menu item of the main menu despite of unsaved 
changes. However, the menu items still work as expected, it just looks like they
are disabled all the time. This behaviour is not a bug in WCT続-GUI but in the 
JDK, the bug report can be found 
[here](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8201310).

Because of an unresolved issue in the JAXB framework, warning messages are
printed to stdout if a XML file is parsed/written. The corresponding issue on 
GitHub can be found [here](https://github.com/javaee/jaxb-v2/issues/1197).
